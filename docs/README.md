# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the entry point for all project management process documentation at OctoAcme. It provides an overview of the PM processes and links to detailed guides.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme projects use a structured, iterative process:

- **Initiation**: Define the business need, stakeholders, and success metrics; create a project one-pager.
- **Planning**: Break work into deliverable increments, prioritize the backlog, estimate effort, plan releases, and manage risks.
- **Execution & Tracking**: Use project boards, run daily and weekly syncs, enforce PR and testing standards, and regularly update stakeholders.
- **Risk & Communication**: Maintain a risk register, proactively communicate risks, and provide status updates.
- **Release & Deployment**: Standardize release workflows, perform pre-release quality checks, and communicate deployments.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: After each key milestone, run retrospectives and track actionable improvements.
